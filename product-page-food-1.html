    <p>Detailed Description: Feed your tropical fish a protein-rich diet scientifically formulated to promote
        healthy growth and cleaner,
        clearer water with API TROPICAL FLAKES Optimal Protein Fish Food. Overfeeding, low palatability and low
        quality lead to unconsumed or poorly digested food which causes waste and raises ammonia levels. High levels
        of ammonia are toxic to fish and can cause gill damage, stress, illness and death. API TROPICAL FLAKES
        Optimal Protein Fish Food is a complete and balanced diet ideal for all types of tropical fish including
        Tetras, Angelfish, Discus, Barbs and Guppies. API Fish Food contains nutritionally-enhanced protein for
        maximum digestion and produce up to 30% less ammonia. The more nutrients your fish digests, the less waste
        and ammonia are released, leaving cleaner, clearer water. Plus, they contain menhaden and squid for optimal
        growth and carotenoids to enhance color. Feed twice a day, and provide only as much as your fish will eat
        within three minutes. API Fish Food is formulated for a variety of popular fish such as cichlids, goldfish,
        tetra, betta, angelfish and more with high quality ingredients fish love such as algae, shrimp, worms and
        more. Keep your fish healthy, happy and colorful with food that contains optimal levels of nutrients as well
        as helps produce less waste, toxins and stress. For delayed release try API VACATION and WEEKEND PYRAMID
        FEEDERS.
